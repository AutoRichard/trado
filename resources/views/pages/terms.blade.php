<p>Where an investor contributes in a currency other than the Naira, foreign exchange gain or loss and fluctuations in currency rates may have an impact on the profit made on such contribution by the investor.<br/>

All profits on contribution shall be converted and returned in Naira based on the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) official exchange rate. The investor therefore enters into any transactions in currencies other than the Naira at their sole risk and shall bear all responsibilities for any gains or loss as a result.<br/>

Unexpected changes in currency exchange market conditions may have an impact on the extent of profit the investor would be exposed to such as when there is an upward or downward movement in the relevant rates.<br/>

The investor understands and is able to assume the risk of loss associated and agrees to be liable for any resulting deficit this might have on contributions made or profits earned.<br/>
